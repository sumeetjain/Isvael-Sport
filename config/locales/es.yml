      p1: "I have been involved in sport my whole life.  I started judo at the age of four.  I was trained by my father, Gerald Lafon, who now runs Judo America San Diego.  My first competition was at age six.  I won my first of twelve junior national titles at age seven and by thirteen I was traveling the world with the US national judo team.  By age fifteen I had won my first Senior national title and in 1992, at 18 years old, I made my first Olympic team.  I then retired from competition and decided to focus on my studies.  I attended Miramar College then transferred to San Diego State, where I majored in psychology.  In 2004, twelve years later, I made a comeback and in 2008, I made my second Olympic team, just a few months shy of 35!"
      p2: "Upon returning from the 2008 Olympics, I decided to use my experience and knowledge to help others achieve their fitness goals by becoming a personal trainer.  I got my first start as a trainer working at 24 Hr Fitness. In 2009, I began training people out of my home, where I felt I could better meet my clients needs.  In 2010, Israel Hernandez and I decided to combine our knowledge, experience and passion, and open up SoCal Judo."

      seoi_history:
        title: "History of Seoi"
        p0: 'It has been and still is one of the most popular and highest scoring techniques seen in competition: Seoi-nage.  It is one of the most used throws in elite  judo competition.  It is classified as a hand technique, Te-waza, and involves throwing an opponent over the shoulder.  Seoi-nage is most commonly referred to as "shoulder throw."'
        p1: "Seoi comes from a verb meaning to carry on the back and this can help us in picturing how the technique should be done. Imagine a man wanting to unload a heavy sack of coal from the low back of a truck. He grasps the top corners of the sack turns round and sinking down hoists the sack on to his back. This is the action of seoi-nage."
        p2: "It's popularity in judo and sumo is possibly explained due to the historical fact that Japanese always carried big loads on their shoulders and backs, from sacks of rice and bundles of wood to emperors and shogunates in their royal carriages."
        p3: "This throw is traditionally the favorite of the little man. However, in these days of weight divisions men of any size can use it. The advantage of this throw for a smaller man is that once he is in position even though outweighed by two or three stone it is still possible to carry it through against resistance."
