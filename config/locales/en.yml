      intro: "My name is Valerie Gotay. I am a 5th degree black belt and 2x Olympian in the sport of judo and a purple belt in Brazilian jujitsu. I am also a mother of 2 and a certified NASM (National Association of Sports Medicine) personal trainer."
      p1: "I have been involved in sport my whole life.  I started judo at the age of four.  I was trained by my father, Gerald Lafon, who now runs Judo America San Diego.  My first competition was at age six.  I won my first of twelve junior national titles at age seven and by thirteen I was traveling the world with the US national judo team.  By age fifteen I had won my first Senior national title and in 1992, at 18 years old, I made my first Olympic team.  I then retired from competition and decided to focus on my studies.  I attended Miramar College then transferred to San Diego State, where I majored in psychology.  In 2004, twelve years later, I made a comeback and in 2008, I made my second Olympic team, just a few months shy of 35!"
      p2: "Upon returning from the 2008 Olympics, I decided to use my experience and knowledge to help others achieve their fitness goals by becoming a personal trainer.  I got my first start as a trainer working at 24 Hr Fitness. In 2009, I began training people out of my home, where I felt I could better meet my clients needs.  In 2010, Israel Hernandez and I decided to combine our knowledge, experience and passion, and open up SoCal Judo."
